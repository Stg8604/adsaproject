#  Minimising Debts Application
A repository in Java which takes a group of users, and the amount they owe each other as input, and uses Maximum-flow algorithm to mininimise and simplify the number of transactions between the users.

# Cloning the Respository

- Clone the repository by entering the following in the terminal:
- ```
  git clone https://github.com/Stg8604/adsaproject.git
  ```

# Future Development Ideas

- Using a dbms to store the values and querying from a server.
- Finding a faster and more efficient algorithm to reduce the graph.
- Partitioning the storage across multiple servers to support concurrent requests.
  
# Changes after review-1

- Ford-Fulkerson and Edmon-Karp algorithms are added and the time values for tthe same input graph are computed.
- Time value for the the same graph using Dinic's algorithm is also computed
- A database in JS using SQLlite
